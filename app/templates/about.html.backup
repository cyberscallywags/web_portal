  <section id="history">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Cyber Scallywags was born from the belief that technology should empower
      people, not exploit them. Founded by <strong>Colin Moore-Hill</strong>,
      the movement began as a loose network of ethical hackers, data
      scientists, and civic technologists determined to give back to their
      communities. Its roots stretch into the Welsh valleys—places of grit,
      creativity, and collaboration—where the aim has always been to turn
      underused skills and forgotten spaces into hubs of digital and civic revival.

  <section id="aims">
    <h2>Aims & Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Empower Communities:</strong> Bring digital opportunity back
          to rural and post-industrial areas through open collaboration.</li>
      <li><strong>Educate & Upskill:</strong> Run training, apprenticeships,
          and mentorships in Python, data science, and ethical tech.</li>
      <li><strong>Build Open Tech:</strong> Create and maintain open-source
          tools that serve social good—data governance, graph analytics,
          civic apps, and more.</li>
      <li><strong>Champion Ethics & Governance:</strong> Promote privacy,
          transparency, and responsible AI in every project.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="future">
    <h2>Our Vision for the Future</h2>
    <p>
      Looking ahead, Cyber Scallywags hopes to expand its reach beyond Wales,
      forming a global network of “digital cooperatives” that share knowledge,
      code, and creativity. We envision converted factories becoming maker
      labs, young technologists leading open-data initiatives, and
      cross-community projects connecting people through graphs, AI, and
      storytelling.  
      <br><br>
      <strong>We’re not just building software—we’re rebuilding trust in
      technology.</strong>
